1. Place the server code in your server
1. Place the client code on the client, and insert the token from the server when a logged in user visits the page

## Billing Settings options
In the init for a request embed, these are the options which can customize the embed

| Attribute        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| url      | string      |   URL of your servicebot instance |
| selector | [Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element)|  The element you want to turn into a form |
| handleResponse | function(response) | a function which gets called after billing operations occur |
| token | string | A JSON web token for the user account being managed (generated by the server code) |
| [disablePlanChange] | boolean | if true, a customer will not be able to change their plan using the embeddable |

## Example Billing Settings Config
```javascript
    Servicebot.BillingSettings({
        url : "https://example.serviceshop.io", 
        selector : document.getElementById('servicebot-management-form'),
        handleResponse : (response) => { 
            console.log(response);
        },
        token: "INSERT_TOKEN_HERE",
        disablePlanChange: false
    })
```

## Tips
- If your language/framework is not available, you can use a JSON Web Token library to generate a token, or, using an administrator account, use [this](https://api-docs.servicebot.io/#operation--users--id--token-post) API to get a token for a specific customer
- The server side code can be reused for the [seat management embed](https://docs.servicebot.io/seat-management-embed) as it also uses a JSON Web Token
- Changing a pricing plan will trigger a webhook call
