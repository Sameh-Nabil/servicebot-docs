# ServiceBot Introduction

ServiceBot is an open source ecommerce and automation platform for services. The objective is to bring enterprise level automation to small and medium sized businesses, as well as bringing forth a new e-commerce platform designed around services.

ServiceBot is built using Javascript and the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework on [Node](https://nodejs.org). It is both an open source solution and a managed Platform as a Service (PaaS), available at [servicebot.io](http://servicebot.io/).

We welcome questions and feedback via our [discource community](http://community.servicebot.io/), as well as [contributions](https://github.com/servicebot/servicebot). For general discussion, feel free to visit our [Gitter Chatroom](https://gitter.im/service-bot/Lobby).

We are automation engineers for fortune 500 companies. We were operating a web development company and needed a way to manage our services and subscriptions, so became ServiceBot.
