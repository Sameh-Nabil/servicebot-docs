        url : "https://example.serviceshop.io", 
        selector : document.getElementById('servicebot-login-form'),
        handleResponse : (response) => {
            console.log(response.user) //user object
            console.log(response.token) //JSON Web Token to be validated from your app, also contains user object encoded
            console.log(response.seats) //seats this user belongs to
            console.log(response.instances) //service instances this user owns
            console.log(response.oauthResponse) //the response from an oauthProvider used to login such as Google
        }
    })
```
## Tips
- If you pass inviteToken or resetToken and uid as URL variables, they will be pulled automatically into the embed, the invite email and reset password email should have these url variables automatically attached to the URL so you just need to make sure the URLs your configure are pointed to a page with the login embed
- You can decode the JSON web token to get the user object which will include references to service instances, seats, and funds
